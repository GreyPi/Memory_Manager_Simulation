# Class Project

**Decription:**

  In this project I write a simulation that explores the effects of limited
  memory and memory management policies. The simulator will read policy information and the
  characteristics of the workload from input files and then will simulate the execution of the
  processes as well as decisions of Memory Manager (MM). The simulator will generate an output
  file with the trace of important events, as well as the memory map and the input queue status after
  each event. At the end of the simulation my program will also print the average turnaround time
  per process.
  
**How to Run:**
  1. Download Zip folder.
  2. Extract files.
  3. Run main.cpp
  4. out1/2/3.txt will ouput the process arriving, the queue, and the memory map.
